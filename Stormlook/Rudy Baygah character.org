#+TITLE: Rudy Baygah Character Sheet
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* Background

Runs With Shovel Land Steward -- known by his common name, Rudy Baygah
-- works as a farmer, growing root vegetables and grain in the
hardscrable soil. His family's farming lineage extends back at least
three generations, beyond which records are unavailable. His surname,
Land Steward, reflects the family's contribution to the community. As
per the tribe's custom, his parents conferred his given name based on
what his father was doing just before his mother entered the birthing
process. The tribe gives all children a common name to use within the
broader community.

Rudy also serves as a guide to travelers wishing to pass through the
nearby wilds. He speaks not of his experiences and encounters in the
there with members of the Circle. Some in the community believe his
sojourns endanger the community, fearing that he maintains pacts with
malevolent entities in order to survive the treacherous
environs. Others are irresistibly attracted to his enigmatic
aura. Regardless of their opinions about his other profession,
however, the Circle relies on nourishment from his crops, meager
though they are.

Equipped with his encyclopedic knowledge of Ironland plants, Rudy
skillfully employs flora as food and medicines. He often uses
hallucinogens to gain insight into matters that defy logic.

A childhood accident left Rudy with a partially disabled left hand. He
developed proficiency with the bow and sling, but struggles to wield
weapons requiring a two-handed grip.

# As you build relationships and complete quests in the service of
# others, you create bonds by making the Forge a Bond move (page 74).
#
# Bonds provide narrative texture to your world by fleshing out other
# characters and communities. They give you places to return to, and
# people to reconnect with, when your life as Ironsworn has taken its
# toll. Bonds also provide mechanical benefits when you act within a
# community or interact with someone with whom you share a bond. For
# example, the Sojourn move (page 71) gives you a bonus to your action
# roll if you have a bond with that community.
# 
# The bonds progress track on your character sheet represents the
# connections you have made. When you successfully Forge a Bond, you
# mark progress (one tick). When your time as Ironsworn is done, you
# Write Your Epilogue (page 77). When you make that move, you tally
# the number of filled boxes on your bonds progress track as your
# progress score. See page 14 to learn more about progress tracks and
# progress moves.

** 1: background bond

Among the townspeople Rudy trusts is the village chronicler. She
enjoys a reputation as a fair and honest journalist, traits that Rudy
can leverage as he strives to win over those who doubt his loyalties.

** 2: background bond

Rudy has met a number of Firstborn while exploring the wilds. One race
in particular accommodates Rudy's presence: the Llyth'radeans,
wraithish entities who occupy areas where mist is prevalent. Humanoids
intrigue them and with Stormlook being the nearest settlement, they
aspire to establish mutually beneficial relations.

Llyth'radean society is egalitarian and distributed, operating by
consensus and without central authorities. Rudy has carefully curated
a rapport with them, eventually winning a vote to establish an
alliance. Rudy agreed to act as an intermediary, though he has yet to
approach Stormlook's village council with a proposal. He anticipates
sensitive negotiations and feels he needs to lay the proper groundwork
to sway conservative members.

In return, the Llyth'rades offered their sentinel brigade as
protection. Being stealthy and expert trackers, they've often served
in vanguard roles to alert Rudy of dangers. Their ability to project
illusions also proves useful at drawing threats away. However, their
phantasmal nature prevents them from offensive engagements with
corporeal beings. They're likewise impervious to physical weaponry,
though a skilled wielder of ghostly magic can expose their presence.

* Vows

# When you Swear an Iron Vow (page 98), you give it a rank
# (troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic), and record
# it on your character sheet. You then use a vow progress track to
# mark when you Reach a Milestone (page 100).

** 1: background vow

Rudy wants to comprehensively map the marches and forests that
surround his Circle, and in the process win the trust of skeptical
Stormlookers by proving that he sojourns there in the community's best
interests.

** 2: inciting vow

A rogue adventurer comes to Stormlook seeking a guide across the
Hagorriy Swamp. This route offers a shortcut to Czastavia, an
important Ironland trading post. However, legends of fierce creatures
convince all but the hardiest of travelers to access the village via
the sea. The adventurer refuses to divulge the reason for his haste
and willingness to risk the treacherous crossing, but promises a
lucrative reward for safe passage. Rudy likewise cherishes the
opportunity to chart a hitherto dark territory.

| Max | Reset |
|-----+-------|
|  10 | 2     |

# Momentum represents how you are faring in your quests. It is gained
# and lost through moves. If you have positive momentum, you are
# building on your successes and ready to make decisive moves. If you
# have negative momentum, you have suffered setbacks and your quest is
# in jeopardy.  To learn more about momentum and how it helps and
# hinders your character, see page 11.
# 
# Use the momentum track on the left side of your character sheet to
# record your current momentum. Your character sheet also includes
# boxes to mark your max momentum and momentum reset.
# 
# • Your max momentum starts at +10, and is reduced by one for every
# marked debility.
# 
# • Your momentum reset starts at +2. If you have a one debility
# marked, your reset is +1. If you have more than one debility marked,
# your reset is 0.
# 
# To learn more about debilities, see page 36.

* Health

| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---+---+---+---+---+---|
|   |   |   |   |   | x |

# Health represents your current physical condition and stamina,
# ranked from 0 to +5. Health is reduced when you Endure Harm (page
# 91), and increased when you rest or receive care through moves such
# as Heal (page 63) or Sojourn (page 71).

# If you are at 0 health, scoring a miss when you Endure Harm puts you
# at risk of suffering a debility or dying.

* Spirit

| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---+---+---+---+---+---|
|   |   |   |   |   | x |

# Spirit is your current mental state, ranked from 0 to +5. Spirit is
# reduced when you Endure Stress (page 95). It is increased when you
# find comfort in companionship, success, or relaxed moments through
# moves such as Make Camp (page 64) or Forge a Bond (page 74).

# If you are at 0 spirit, scoring a miss when you Endure Stress puts
# you at risk of suffering a debility or falling into desolation.

* Supply

| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---+---+---+---+---+---|
|   |   |   |   |   | x |

# Supply is an abstract representation of your preparedness, including
# ammo, food, water, and general upkeep. It is ranked from 0 to
# +5. Instead of keeping track of a detailed inventory, you can
# consider most of your mundane gear as covered under supply.
#
# Supply is decreased when you make the Undertake a Journey move (page
# 65). You might also reduce supply as a narrative cost when you face
# hardships as an outcome of other moves. For example, if you make the
# Face Danger move (page 60) to ford a wild river, you might lose some
# gear as a result of a weak hit or miss. Supply is increased when you
# gather provisions through moves such as Resupply (page 63).

# The supply track represents the shared assets among your party. You
# and your allies use the same supply value while you travel
# together. If any of you make a move to increase supply, or suffer
# the result of a move that reduces your supply, each of you adjust
# your supply track accordingly.
#
# When your supply falls to 0, all characters make the Out of Supply
# move (page 97). If you are at 0 supply and suffer additional
# -supply, you each must reduce your health, spirit, or momentum
# tracks by that amount.

* Assets

| Card      |
|-----------|
| Herbalist |
| Wayfinder |
| Archer    |

# Assets represent your background, skills, and traits. They give you
# additional options and bonuses when making a move—or sometimes act
# as their own self-contained moves.
# 
# Assets provide both mechanical and narrative benefits. For example,
# if you are an Herbalist, you gain bonuses to your moves when
# treating injuries or sicknesses. You can envision your character
# identifying plants, diagnosing rare illnesses, and summoning up
# obscure facts about herbal remedies. Even when you aren’t making
# moves, your role colors the interests and manner of your
# character. Also, your expertise might offer story possibilities and
# new quests as you interact with others in need of your services.
# 
# Ironsworn assets are formatted as printable cards, available for
# download at ironswornrpg.com. Put them alongside your character
# sheet for easy reference. Each asset card includes three abilities.

* Equipment

|   |   |
|---+---|
|   |   |

# Make note of any important equipment or items you start with. These
# are things that might impact the narrative and the moves you make,
# or provide texture to your character’s background. They don’t offer
# mechanical bonuses unless they are represented by an asset, such as
# a weapon used in a combat talent.
# 
# You can assume you are equipped for travel and adventure as
# represented by your supply track. Don’t worry about managing rations
# or ammo or other mundane necessities.
# 
# There are no limitations by the rules, but envision your character’s
# place in society and consider the availability of resources in your
# version of the Ironlands. By default, a fine sword or a set of
# quality armor is rare, and marks you as someone of note. It
# influences how others react to you in the fiction of your game.
# 
# If you want to begin your adventures as a typical Ironlander,
# envision yourself outfitted with cheap, mundane gear. A hand-me-down
# set of quilted armor.  A ratty traveling cloak. A battered wooden
# shield. A spear and a worn knife.  Improving your lot in life can be
# part of your narrative journey.
