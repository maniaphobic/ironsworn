#+TITLE: Olive Grove Campaign

* Setting

An Arab scout unit patroling lands north of Mashiq comes across a
small band of Crusaders camped in an olive grove. They sit around a
fire and number about eight, comprised of warriors, archers, and
squires. One wears the vestments of clergy. An equipment-laden horse
is tied to a tree just outside the light cast by the fire.

Reports suggest that a large column of enemy soldiers marches to the
east of Mashiq. The camped soldiers may be scouts.

The militia commander dispatches Ahmed's unit to attack the encamped
soldiers with two objectives:

  - assuming they're a detachment from the large force, prevent them
    from escaping to report the raid by Ahmed's unit. this might draw
    the invaders toward Mashiq.
  - recover as many weapons and supplies as possible

Ahmed's unit contains ten personnel: five infantry warriors, two
mounted warriors, and three archers. Abdullah is an archer.
