# Supply is an abstract representation of your preparedness, including
# ammo, food, water, and general upkeep. It is ranked from 0 to
# +5. Instead of keeping track of a detailed inventory, you can
# consider most of your mundane gear as covered under supply.
#
# Supply is decreased when you make the Undertake a Journey move (page
# 65). You might also reduce supply as a narrative cost when you face
# hardships as an outcome of other moves. For example, if you make the
# Face Danger move (page 60) to ford a wild river, you might lose some
# gear as a result of a weak hit or miss. Supply is increased when you
# gather provisions through moves such as Resupply (page 63).

# The supply track represents the shared assets among your party. You
# and your allies use the same supply value while you travel
# together. If any of you make a move to increase supply, or suffer
# the result of a move that reduces your supply, each of you adjust
# your supply track accordingly.

# When your supply falls to 0, all characters make the Out of Supply
# move (page 97). If you are at 0 supply and suffer additional
# -supply, you each must reduce your health, spirit, or momentum
# tracks by that amount.
