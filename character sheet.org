# As you build relationships and complete quests in the service of
# others, you create bonds by making the Forge a Bond move (page 74).
# 
# Bonds provide narrative texture to your world by fleshing out other
# characters and communities. They give you places to return to, and
# people to reconnect with, when your life as Ironsworn has taken its
# toll. Bonds also provide mechanical benefits when you act within a
# community or interact with someone with whom you share a bond. For
# example, the Sojourn move (page 71) gives you a bonus to your action
# roll if you have a bond with that community.
# 
# The bonds progress track on your character sheet represents the
# connections you have made. When you successfully Forge a Bond, you
# mark progress (one tick). When your time as Ironsworn is done, you

* Vows

# When you Swear an Iron Vow (page 98), you give it a rank
# (troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic), and record
# it on your character sheet. You then use a vow progress track to
# mark when you Reach a Milestone (page 100).

# Momentum represents how you are faring in your quests. It is gained
# and lost through moves. If you have positive momentum, you are
# building on your successes and ready to make decisive moves. If you
# have negative momentum, you have suffered setbacks and your quest is
# in jeopardy.  To learn more about momentum and how it helps and
# hinders your character, see page 11.
# 
# Use the momentum track on the left side of your character sheet to
# record your current momentum. Your character sheet also includes
# boxes to mark your max momentum and momentum reset.
# 
# • Your max momentum starts at +10, and is reduced by one for every
# marked debility.
# 
# • Your momentum reset starts at +2. If you have a one debility
# marked, your reset is +1. If you have more than one debility marked,
# your reset is 0.
# 
# To learn more about debilities, see page 36.

* Health

| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---+---+---+---+---+---|
|   |   |   |   |   | x |

# Health represents your current physical condition and stamina,
# ranked from 0 to +5. Health is reduced when you Endure Harm (page
# 91), and increased when you rest or receive care through moves such
# as Heal (page 63) or Sojourn (page 71).

# If you are at 0 health, scoring a miss when you Endure Harm puts you
# at risk of suffering a debility or dying.

* Spirit

| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---+---+---+---+---+---|
|   |   |   |   |   | x |

# Spirit is your current mental state, ranked from 0 to +5. Spirit is
# reduced when you Endure Stress (page 95). It is increased when you
# find comfort in companionship, success, or relaxed moments through
# moves such as Make Camp (page 64) or Forge a Bond (page 74).

# If you are at 0 spirit, scoring a miss when you Endure Stress puts
# you at risk of suffering a debility or falling into desolation.

* Supply

| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---+---+---+---+---+---|
|   |   |   |   |   | x |

# Supply is an abstract representation of your preparedness, including
# ammo, food, water, and general upkeep. It is ranked from 0 to
# +5. Instead of keeping track of a detailed inventory, you can
# consider most of your mundane gear as covered under supply.
#
# Supply is decreased when you make the Undertake a Journey move (page
# 65). You might also reduce supply as a narrative cost when you face
# hardships as an outcome of other moves. For example, if you make the
# Face Danger move (page 60) to ford a wild river, you might lose some
# gear as a result of a weak hit or miss. Supply is increased when you
# gather provisions through moves such as Resupply (page 63).

# The supply track represents the shared assets among your party. You
# and your allies use the same supply value while you travel
# together. If any of you make a move to increase supply, or suffer
# the result of a move that reduces your supply, each of you adjust
# your supply track accordingly.
#
# When your supply falls to 0, all characters make the Out of Supply
# move (page 97). If you are at 0 supply and suffer additional
# -supply, you each must reduce your health, spirit, or momentum
# tracks by that amount.

* Assets

| Card   |
|--------|
|        |
|        |
|        |

# Assets represent your background, skills, and traits. They give you
# additional options and bonuses when making a move—or sometimes act
# as their own self-contained moves.
# 
# Assets provide both mechanical and narrative benefits. For example,
# if you are an Herbalist, you gain bonuses to your moves when
# treating injuries or sicknesses. You can envision your character
# identifying plants, diagnosing rare illnesses, and summoning up
# obscure facts about herbal remedies. Even when you aren’t making
# moves, your role colors the interests and manner of your
# character. Also, your expertise might offer story possibilities and
# new quests as you interact with others in need of your services.
# 
# Ironsworn assets are formatted as printable cards, available for
# download at ironswornrpg.com. Put them alongside your character
# sheet for easy reference. Each asset card includes three abilities.

* Equipment

|   |   |
|---+---|
|   |   |

# Make note of any important equipment or items you start with. These
# are things that might impact the narrative and the moves you make,
# or provide texture to your character’s background. They don’t offer
# mechanical bonuses unless they are represented by an asset, such as
# a weapon used in a combat talent.
# 
# You can assume you are equipped for travel and adventure as
# represented by your supply track. Don’t worry about managing rations
# or ammo or other mundane necessities.
# 
# There are no limitations by the rules, but envision your character’s
# place in society and consider the availability of resources in your
# version of the Ironlands. By default, a fine sword or a set of
# quality armor is rare, and marks you as someone of note. It
# influences how others react to you in the fiction of your game.
# 
# If you want to begin your adventures as a typical Ironlander,
# envision yourself outfitted with cheap, mundane gear. A hand-me-down
# set of quilted armor.  A ratty traveling cloak. A battered wooden
# shield. A spear and a worn knife.  Improving your lot in life can be
# part of your narrative journey.
